# Joey Rodriguez

Self-taught developer. Building with AI.

No CS degree. No bootcamp. I taught myself to build software with Claude Code
and shipped everything you see here — CLI tools, MCP servers, native macOS apps,
and AI agents. NYC-based.

## Projects

- **[SkillScore](https://github.com/joeynyc/skillscore)** — CLI tool that evaluates AI agent skills and produces quality scores. Works with any SKILL.md-based skill from skills.sh, ClaHub, GitHub, or local directories. `TypeScript` `Bun`
- **[OpenClaw Mission Control](https://github.com/joeynyc/openclaw-mission-control)** — Native macOS command center for OpenClaw AI agents. Real-time dashboard, live chat, and service monitoring. `Swift` `SwiftUI`
- **[CSV Cleaner Agent](https://github.com/joeynyc/-CSVCleanerAgent)** — AI agent that cleans messy CSV files using the Claude Agent SDK. Detects data quality issues, normalizes formats, and preps CSVs for import. `TypeScript` `Bun` `Claude Agent SDK`
- **[Govee MCP Server](https://github.com/joeynyc/Govee-MCP)** — MCP server that lets AI assistants control Govee smart lights through natural language. Security-first with device allowlists and rate limiting. `TypeScript` `MCP`
